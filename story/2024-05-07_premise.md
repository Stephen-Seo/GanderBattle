# Premise of the story

A wanted poster for "The Wandering Gander" is posted in the town square. One
adventurer decides to try their luck in capturing Gander Schwartz. In a fateful
encounter, a battle takes place in the plains near the Elemental Dungeon.

## The Battle

The player takes control of Gander as the battle begins.

"Are you the Leg?" Is all Gander asks of the adventurer before battle starts.

### Gander Wins

If Gander defeats the adventurer, he begins to interrogate them.

"I didn't want to cause harm, but it seems this battle was inevitable. I'll be
brief because I don't have much time. Someone has been disposing of bodies in
the Elemental Dungeon. So I'll ask one last time, are you, or do you know, the
Leg?"

The adventurer relays that they merely were on a quest for fame and fortune.

"..I see. Well, if I succeed in a quest of my own, you may get such things if
you tag along. I don't think I can tackle this cult on my own. What do you say?"

### Gander loses

Basically, a generic bad end.

## Post Battle: The Secluded Forest

This project is concerned with only the Battle, so continuing the story past
this point may be premature.
